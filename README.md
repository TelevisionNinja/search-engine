# search-engine
This is a basic search engine I made for my information retrieval class. It uses flex, a stopwords list, low frequency term filtering, a linear probing hash table for the map file, a linked list for the postings file, and an array accumulator. The weights use the formula: rtf * idf with log base 10.
