He left a lot of money on the table to stay here. That's what he wanted to do. I understand that. That's my choice, that's his choice. I understand that to stay here, you're not going to get a free-agent deal. You're not going to do it. You can't. It's not possible. You're bidding against one team. I understand you're going to take a discount to stay. Do I want to do that? Absolutely.\" During spring training, the Red Sox made Lester a lowball offer in the neighborhood of four years and $70 million, well below market value. The pitcher informed the team through his agents that he did not want to negotiate during the season. <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/boston/mlb/story/_/id/10472563/jon-lester-confirms-take-discount-stay-boston-red-sox\">Story &#187;</a>","credit":"Jim Davis/Getty Images","width":2048,"height":1524,"title":"Hometown Discount Discussion","alt":"Jon Lester","lastModified":1406819213},{"id":11288434,"url":"http://a.espncdn.com/photo/2014/0730/mlb_lester_10.jpg","links":{"web":{"href":"http://espn.go.com/mlb/photos/gallery/_/id/11288443/image/10/best-season-yet-interrupted-jon-lester-years"},"mobile":{"href":"http://espn.go.com/mlb/photos/gallery/_/id/11288443/image/10/version/mobile/best-season-yet-interrupted-jon-lester-years"},"test":{"href":"http://sports-uat.espn.go.com/espn/photos/gallery?id=11288443&image=10"}},"slug":"best-season-yet-interrupted-jon-lester-years","caption":"In the midst of the best season of his career (10-7, 2.52 ERA, 1.12 WHIP, 149 strikeouts in 143 innings over 21 starts for Boston), Lester's value skyrocketed as it appeared more and more as if he was going to price himself out of the range the Red Sox were comfortable paying him for a contract. As the trade deadline approached, it became apparent that the team and player were not on the same page in terms of a new deal.
