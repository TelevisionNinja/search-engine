FOXBOROUGH, Mass. -- Charlie Davies wanted to start on Sunday, no question about it. He wanted to be out on the pitch when referee Chris Penso blew his whistle, and he wanted to inject energy and pace right off the bat against the Fire. <BR><BR>But after going 90 minutes last week in Toronto, and 61 minutes against Kansas City five days earlier, Davies found himself on the bench. From there, he watched his team go down a goal, then watched them level it, all while patiently waiting to hear his name from the technical area. <BR><BR>Then, around the 58th minute, he got the call. He quickly shed his warmup shirt, donned his No. 9 jersey and, within moments, burst onto the pitch. Two minutes later, he scored the game-winner, tipping the game in the Revolution&rsquo;s favor and sending them to a 2-1 comeback win.<BR><BR></p><div class="mod-inline image image-right"><div style="margin-left:10px; width:300px;"><img src="http://a.espncdn.com//photo/2014/0907/bos_g_davies01jr_300x200.jpg"  alt="Charlie Davies" border="0" align="middle" /><div style="width: 300px;"><cite>Winslow Townson/Getty Images</cite>Charlie Davies and Fire goalkeeper Sean Johnson watch as Davies scores the game-winner.</div></div></div><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s kind of my job, to come on the field and change the game,&rdquo; Davies said. &ldquo;I wanted to make an immediate impact, and I was fortunate enough to have Jermaine (Jones) play me a great ball.&rdquo;<BR><BR>At first blush, the absence of Davies from the lineup was curious in some respects. Since scoring in back-to-back games earlier this summer, he infused much-needed life into a stagnant attack and appeared to earn the role of starting striker until further notice.<BR><BR>But leaving Davies out of the lineup for another critical conference clash was by no means due to poor form. Rather, it had everything to do with the game plan, and keeping Davies, who hasn&rsquo;t played a full season since 2011, from burning out.<BR><BR>&ldquo;As a staff, we really felt that tonight was going to be one of those games where later in the game, his speed was going to make a difference,&rdquo; Heaps said. &ldquo;Charlie&rsquo;s put in a lot of minutes, so we were also managing that as well, so with all the factors, we thought it was a good time to bring him in (later).&rdquo;<BR><BR>That decision proved to be a masterstroke. The Fire, who showed signs of life early, were starting to fade. The Revolution, who entered the game on a four-game unbeaten streak, were collectively pressing for a go-ahead goal in front of the home crowd.  In short, it was the perfect scenario for Davies to take center stage.<BR><BR>And that&rsquo;s exactly what unfolded at the hour mark. After Jone Goncalves dug the ball out of his own end, he raced ahead and linked up with Jones, who received it and raced ahead while dodging a pair of defenders. At the last moment, he released it to a streaking Davies, who chased it down and, with only Sean Johnson to beat, sent it through.<BR><BR>&ldquo;You could probably see my eyes get real big,&rdquo; Davies said. &ldquo;I saw it was going to be a one-on-one with me and Sean Johnson, and I know he&rsquo;s a big keeper. So you have to put it low and in the corner, and you have to hit it with good pace to beat him, which I was fortunate enough to do.&rdquo;<BR><BR>And that&rsquo;s essentially what Heaps asked Davies to do just before the No. 9 flashed on the fourth official&rsquo;s board. <BR><BR>&ldquo;(They&rsquo;ve) got two tired center backs, and that&rsquo;s what we felt was a good time to put Charlie in,&rdquo; Heaps said. &ldquo;We went to him earlier than we thought, and he went in and changed the game within two minutes.&rdquo;<BR><BR>Davies may not have started, but Sunday&rsquo;s match was proof of what can happen when a coach and player are on the same page, regardless of how it looks on paper.<BR><BR>&ldquo;I was starting to feel it a little bit,&rdquo; Davies said, alluding to the two starts he earned within a four-day span. &ldquo;But I felt good today, and I knew that it was probably for the best that I get a rest today. It&rsquo;s one of those things where you have to respect the coach&rsquo;s decision and be ready for when your name is called.&rdquo;</div>

FOXBOROUGH, Mass. -- Charlie Davies didn&rsquo;t need much time to make his presence felt Sunday night.<BR><BR>Two minutes after coming off the bench, the Boston College product raced onto a Jermaine Jones pass and slotted it through in the 60th minute to send the New England Revolution to a 2-1 win over the Chicago Fire at Gillette Stadium.<BR><BR>Davies joined Diego Fagundez on the scoresheet as Fagundez notched his first goal in more than three months when he headed through a Lee Nguyen pass in the 41st minute. Chicago&rsquo;s Sanna Nyassi opened the scoring in similar fashion when he glanced a Quincy Amerikwa cross into the net during the 28th minute.<BR><BR>The win extended the Revolution&rsquo;s unbeaten streak to five straight (4-0-1), while the Fire were unable to build from last week&rsquo;s win over FC Dallas. <BR><BR><strong>What it means:</strong> It seemed like dj vu all over again for the Revolution during the first half. Nyassi&rsquo;s strike put them in an early ditch for the second straight game. But just as they did against Sporting Kansas City last week, the Revolution responded before the break, this time from the forehead of Fagundez. With the match knotted coming out of the break, Jay Heaps tabbed Davies to enter the match in the 58th minute and was immediately rewarded when Davies scored the breakthrough in the 60th minute. With the Revolution heading into the middle of September with a five-game unbeaten run, it appears they&rsquo;re getting hot at the right time for the second straight year. <BR><BR><strong>Stat of the match:</strong> In his second start in five days for the Revolution, designated player Jermaine Jones proved to be an active participant by collecting a game-high 108 touches.<BR><BR><strong>Scoreboard watch:</strong> The Revolution claimed sole possession of third place and pulled within three points of second-place Sporting Kansas City, who remained stuck at 42 points after dropping a 2-1 loss to the New York Red Bulls on Saturday. <BR><BR><strong>Jones gets long look in second start:</strong> Jones earned his second straight start only four days after going the first 45 minutes in last Wednesday&rsquo;s 3-1 win over Sporting Kansas City. The 32-year-old midfielder went 90-plus minutes before he was spelled in stoppage time by Daigo Kobayashi. During his time on the pitch, Jones collected his second assist in as many games, completed 82 percent of his passes and was awarded his first caution in a Revolution uniform for good measure in the 78th minute. <BR><BR><strong>Three changes to Revs lineup:</strong> Heaps made three changes to his lineup, with Scott Caldwell returning from suspension, while Patrick Mullins and Fagundez both reclaimed their spots in the XI. With Caldwell, Mullins and Fagundez back in the lineup, Teal Bunbury, Kobayashi and Davies were among the substitutes for Sunday&rsquo;s match. To no one&rsquo;s surprise, all three saw the pitch in the second half. <BR><BR><strong>Impact on tap:</strong> The Revolution will close their three-game homestand on Saturday when they host the Montreal Impact. Kickoff is set for 7:30 p.m. The last time the squads met, the Impact triumphed with a 2-0 win at Stade Saputo on May 31.</div>

Making it nine points in nine days will be the objective for the New England Revolution (11-12-3, 36 points) when they host the Chicago Fire (5-6-14, 29 points) on Sunday at Gillette Stadium. Kickoff is set for 7:00 p.m.<BR><BR>The Revolution enter Sunday's game days removed from a 3-1 win over second-place Sporting Kansas City, which gave them sole possession of third place with eight matches remaining. Designated player <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/31793/Jermaine-Jones">Jermaine Jones</a> earned his first start in a Revolution uniform, but it was <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/101587/Lee-Nguyen">Lee Nguyen</a> who stole the show by pocketing a pair of second-half goals to steer the squad to its third straight win.<BR><BR>As for the Fire, they'll be looking to build on last weekend's 1-0 win over FC Dallas after dropping points in their previous two. New addition <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/5510/Robert-Earnshaw">Robert Earnshaw</a> scored the decisive strike late to keep the Fire's postseason hopes alive, albeit for the time being, as the squad currently resides in eighth place with nine games to go.<BR><BR>Of course, the subplot to Sunday's match is the small matter that both organizations were vouching for the services of Jones, the biggest free agent on the market, two weeks ago. With both sides submitting hefty bids, the league conducted the now-infamous blind draw, which awarded the U.S. International to New England.<BR><BR>Here's what to watch for in a match that the Revolution hope to use to inch closer to second place.<BR><BR>&#8226; <strong>Can the Revolution keep their focus late with Robert Earnshaw poised to strike again?</strong> Frank Yallop doesn't have an arsenal of magic bullets on his bench, but one player whom the Chicago coach can count upon is recent addition Robert Earnshaw. Although the former Toronto forward hasn't reached full fitness yet, he's already scored twice off the bench, with his latest sending the Fire to its fifth win of the season. With Earnshaw likely to come on late again on Sunday, there's no doubt Revolution keeper <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/136529/Bobby-Shuttleworth">Bobby Shuttleworth</a> will have to do his part to keep his teammates focused.<BR><BR>"We've played against Earnshaw a couple of times when he was in Toronto and he's a very dangerous player who picks up great spots," Shuttleworth told the media on Friday. "You always have to have an eye on him so we'll definitely be prepared for him, and go over tape, and I think we'll be ready."<BR><BR>&#8226; <strong>Will Lee Nguyen add to his recent haul?</strong> There's no question the veteran midfielder has put together a strong season, with a team-high 12 goals. But his influence over the last few weeks has been remarkable. He's scored four goals in his last three, and slotted the game-winners in each of his team's three straight wins. Unless the Fire map out a plan to contain the shifty midfielder, it could be another eventful evening for Nguyen on Sunday.<BR><BR>&#8226; <strong>Don't let the Fire's record fool you.</strong> It's been a trying season for Yallop, to say the least. In his first year with the Fire, the club has struggled to find the win column, with only five victories through 25 games. He sought out Jones, the most coveted free agent available, as a possible midseason solution, then watched the U.S. International slip out of his grasp. But when the Fire hit the field against the Revolution, it'll be a different story. After grabbing four points in their last two encounters -- including a 1-0 win at Gillette Stadium back on July 12 -- there's no doubt that the Fire pose a clear and present danger for the hosts.<BR><BR>"From what I've seen so far, anytime we face Chicago, it's going to be a battle," Revolution midfielder <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/200841/Steve-Neumann">Steve Neumann</a> told the media on Friday. "They've got a great fighting spirit over there, just like we do. We know that they're not going to come here and back down in any way."<BR><BR>&#8226; <strong>How long will Jermaine Jones go?</strong> After going nearly two months without playing, Jones has gone a combined 70 minutes since making his debut last weekend. While Jones would love nothing more than to get more time each match until he reaches full fitness, Revolution coach Jay Heaps isn't going to rush his high-priced midfielder along. With <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/183792/Scott-Caldwell">Scott Caldwell</a> (suspension) ready to return to the fold, and the Revolution set to play their third game in nine days, it wouldn't be surprising to see the U.S. International get anywhere from 25 to 35 minutes against the Fire.<BR><BR>&#8226; <strong>Points becoming more crucial by the week.</strong> The Revolution may have turned the corner on what can only be classified as dreadful summer, but don't expect anything to be taken for granted with only eight games to go. With only five points separating the third-place Revolution from the seventh-place Red Bulls, and a Fire side with a league-high 14 draws in town, Heaps is surely stressing the point that anything less than a victory -- especially at home -- is unacceptable.<BR><BR>"We're at the point now where every game matters," Heaps told the media on Friday. "Every point is important and Chicago -- they don't lose much at all, and it's going to be a hard-fought match, guaranteed."</div>

FOXBOROUGH, Mass. -- It was an inauspicious beginning by any measure to Jermaine Jones&rsquo; home debut on Wednesday.<BR><BR>Nine minutes into his first foray onto the Gillette Stadium pitch, the designated player tried to guide a low and long throw-in by Matt Besler away from the net. Instead, the ball fell to the back post, where Sporting Kansas City midfielder Soony Saad raced over to bury it.<BR><BR>But that wouldn&rsquo;t be the lasting image from Jones&rsquo; first start in a Revolution uniform. Knowing that there would be plenty of time to redeem himself, he bounced back before the close of his 45-minute stint by sending a long ball to Teal Bunbury, who then went at goal to bring the match back to level terms in the Revolution&rsquo;s 3-1 victory over the second-place squad.<BR><BR>&ldquo;I played the ball, and so I have to look, and (then) he makes the run,&rdquo; Jones said. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s funny is that we talked yesterday and before the game, and he scores the goal after that, so everything was perfect.&rdquo;<BR><BR></p><div class="mod-inline image image-right"><div style="margin-left:10px; width:300px;"><img src="http://a.espncdn.com//photo/2014/0903/soc_u_jones11_300x200.jpg"  alt="Jermaine Jones" border="0" align="middle" /><div style="width: 300px;"><cite>Stew Milne/USA TODAY Sports</cite>Jermaine Jones traps the ball as Sporting KC's Igor Juliao defends. </div></div></div><p>It certainly was an ideal finish to a night for a player who probably wouldn&rsquo;t have started under normal circumstances.<BR><BR>Shortly after arriving in Foxborough last week, Jones and coach Jay Heaps sat down and adopted a step-by-step plan to getting Jones match fit following a two-month respite from game action.<BR><BR>The first step, of course, was getting Jones into training. With a handful of sessions under his belt prior to the club&rsquo;s conference clash in Toronto, Jones made his Revolution debut as a 65th minute substitute in Saturday&rsquo;s 3-0 win over the Reds. <BR><BR>But in the 47th minute at BMO Field, Scott Caldwell picked up his fifth caution of the season, which resulted in an automatic one-game ban. With Caldwell unavailable and Andy Dorman nursing an MCL sprain, Heaps found himself with only one option at defensive midfielder for Wednesday&rsquo;s match: the hungry, but not yet completely fit Jermaine Jones.<BR><BR>While there would seem to be concerns about giving Jones the start on Wednesday, the Revolution head coach wasn&rsquo;t worried at all about penciling in his prized midfielder for another important conference contest.<BR><BR>&ldquo;I was excited to start him,&rdquo; Heaps said. &ldquo;We wanted to attack the game from the beginning and put our foot forward knowing that he was coming out at halftime, and that was the game plan. (Steve) Neumann knew that he was going in (at halftime). The entire thing was set up to get Jermaine that 45 minutes.&rdquo; <BR><BR>Although the Revolution grabbed the go-ahead goal while Jones rested on the bench, his first-half foray at midfielder certainly made a positive impression.<BR><BR>&ldquo;I thought he was really good,&rdquo; Heaps said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a little bit different because they were pressing him, so he didn&rsquo;t get a ton of the ball, but when he was able to make a play, he made the goal (basically).&rdquo;<BR><BR>The final stats on Jones&rsquo; night aren&rsquo;t eye-popping by any stretch. He completed 86 percent of his passes, intercepted a pair of his opponents&rsquo; passes and, oh yeah, uncorked a majestic 40-yard pass to Bunbury to dig the Revolution out of what could have been a demoralizing halftime deficit.<BR><BR>Granted, it didn&rsquo;t initially appear that all would end well after Jones&rsquo; early gaffe, which led to a goal that Heaps deemed a &ldquo;fluke.&rdquo; But the combination of Jones&rsquo; superior skill and an impressive performance from Lee Nguyen (two goals) allowed the midfielder to laugh about his mistake after the match.<BR> <BR>&ldquo;I touched it, and the ball goes in the back, and the guy scored,&rdquo; Jones said with a smile. &ldquo;But I think all of (my teammates) -- we were good in shape. We came back and won the game.&rdquo;</div>

FOXBOROUGH, Mass. -- Lee Nguyen ensured that Jermaine Jones&rsquo; home debut was a memorable one by pocketing a pair of second-half goals in a 3-1 victory over Sporting Kansas City on Wednesday at Gillette Stadium.<BR><BR>Nguyen scored in the 48th and 90+4 minutes, while Jones, who started and played the entirety of the first half, assisted on a 45th minute goal from Teal Bunbury. Kansas City built an early lead when Soony Saad opened the scoring in the ninth minute.<BR><BR>With the win, the Revolution extended their unbeaten streak to four (3-0-1), while Kansas City dropped its third straight game.<BR><BR><strong>What it means:</strong> It wasn&rsquo;t the kind of start the hosts had in mind when Saad capitalized on, of all things, a poor clearance from Jones in the ninth minute. But Jones, who started his first meaningful game in more than two months, redeemed himself just before the end of his evening when he blasted a long ball to Bunbury to set up the equalizer. With Jones off for the second half, Nguyen reprised his role of Revolution hero when he fired another long shot that found the back of the net right after the break, and added another right before the final whistle. While the Revolution&rsquo;s chances undoubtedly were helped by the absence of prolific poacher Dom Dwyer, who was serving a one-game ban, New England should be credited for breaking through the physical front employed by Kansas City.<BR><BR><strong>Stat of the match:</strong> Jermaine Jones may have only gone 45 minutes, but he made good during that span by completing a team-high 87 percent of his passes -- the last of which set up the equalizer.  <BR><BR><strong>Scoreboard watch:</strong> After leapfrogging three spots as a result of Saturday&rsquo;s emphatic win at BMO Field, the Revolution, with 36 points, claimed sole possession of third place with Toronto (33 points) losing 1-0 to Philadelphia (33 points) on Wednesday.<BR><BR><strong>Fagundez on the bench again:</strong> Diego Fagundez, who led the Revolution in scoring last year with 13 goals, found himself on the bench for the third time in the last five games. The 19-year-old entered the match with four goals through 22 games, with his last strike coming in a 5-3 bonanza against Philadelphia on May 17. He entered Wednesday&rsquo;s game in the 85th minute, coming on for Kelyn Rowe.<BR><BR><strong>No place like home:</strong> The Revolution will remain in Foxborough for the second of a three-match homestand when they host the Chicago Fire on Sunday. Kickoff is set for 7 p.m. The subplot for Sunday&rsquo;s match, of course, is the fact that two weeks ago, the two organizations were in a tug-of-war for the services of Jones, who landed in New England following the controversial blind draw conducted by MLS.</div>

The opportunity to savor Saturday&rsquo;s triumph in Toronto has quickly come and gone for the New England Revolution (10-12-3, 33 points), who return to the pitch on Wednesday for another critical conference clash with Sporting Kansas City (12-8-6, 42 points) at Gillette Stadium.<BR><BR>The match, which kicks off at 7:30 p.m., will mark the second time this season the longtime conference foes have met. Back on April 26, the Revolution clinched a pair of stoppage-time strikes to secure a 2-0 win over the defending champions.<BR><BR>For the hosts, the midweek match presents an opportunity to pick up right where they left off following last weekend&rsquo;s 3-0 win over Toronto. The victory not only extended the club&rsquo;s modest unbeaten run to three (2-0-1), but it also marked the first time this season that the Revolution posted consecutive clean sheets.<BR><BR>The picture hasn&rsquo;t been quite as rosy for the Revolution&rsquo;s adversaries, who enter the contest licking the wounds from an embarrassing 3-1 home loss to the ninth-place Houston Dynamo on national television. Making matters worse, cautions to <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/66739/Benny-Feilhaber">Benny Feilhaber</a> and <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/171809/Dom-Dwyer">Dom Dwyer</a> will force both to miss Wednesday&rsquo;s match due to yellow card accumulation.<BR><BR>With nine points separating the third-place Revolution from second-place Kansas City, here&rsquo;s what to watch for during a classic &ldquo;six-point&rdquo; contest on Wednesday.<BR><BR><strong>Don't get overconfident.</strong> Few would blame the Revolution if they believed that their summertime struggles were effectively over. Not only have they stayed unbeaten in their last three, but they&rsquo;ve improved their form on defense with back-to-back shutouts. Plus, the three-goal shift put in by the offense on Saturday has likely turned more than a few skeptics into believers. However, Revolution midfielder <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/146067/Teal-Bunbury">Teal Bunbury</a> said it&rsquo;s far too early to believe they&rsquo;ve turned the corner.<BR><BR>&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;re hitting our stride now, and we&rsquo;re getting good results,&rdquo; said Bunbury. &ldquo;But we know there (are) still a lot of games left to be played. So we don&rsquo;t want to get too far ahead of ourselves; we want to build from each result that we have.&rdquo;<BR><BR><strong>Will <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/31793/Jermaine-Jones">Jermaine Jones</a> get the start?</strong> After Scott Caldwell&rsquo;s 47th-minute caution in Toronto spelled a subsequent one-game ban, speculation immediately ran rampant that Jones could be in line for his first start, and at the friendly confines of Gillette Stadium, no less. Following Saturday&rsquo;s 25-minute cameo, Jones admitted that he isn&rsquo;t at 100 percent. But even though he may not be ready to play 90 minutes, don&rsquo;t be surprised if the U.S. International finds himself in the starting lineup and slotted for 60 minutes, especially considering that Jones is the only natural defensive midfielder available.<BR><BR><strong>Heaps isn&rsquo;t overlooking depleted K.C.</strong> The squad that Kansas City will bring to Foxborough certainly won&rsquo;t be its strongest due to the suspensions of Benny Feilhaber and leading scorer Dom Dwyer. And after the Revolution handed Peter Vermes&rsquo; squad a 2-0 loss earlier this season even with Feilhaber and Dwyer on the pitch, it&rsquo;s clear that the defending champions are the underdogs. But as you might expect, Revolution coach Jay Heaps isn&rsquo;t penciling in three points ahead of the clash.<BR><BR>&ldquo;Any way you look at it, you have to be prepared for a Kansas City team that&rsquo;s going to be difficult to play against,&rdquo; Heaps said. &ldquo;Any time new players come in, or new players play, it&rsquo;s a different set of challenges, and neither one of them is easier than the other.&rdquo;<BR><BR><strong>Will Kansas City play for the draw?</strong> It wouldn&rsquo;t be surprising to see the short-handed Kansas City squad march into Foxborough with one point as the primary objective. Not only will two of their best attacking players be absent, but under Vermes&rsquo; watch, Kansas City has often employed an overly physical and undeniably negative brand of soccer on the road. In fact, for all of the artistry they display in the attacking third, Kansas City leads the league in the fouls department, racking up an average of 14.8 per match. On the road alone, that stat climbs to 16.8. With that in mind, expect Kansas City to come out intent on disrupting and demoralizing the Revolution from start to finish.  <BR><BR><strong>Can the defense rise to the occasion again?</strong> It&rsquo;s tempting to say that the defense has found its stride after watching the way Saturday&rsquo;s match in Toronto unfolded. Not only did the Revolution keep a dangerous and quick-strike squad off the board, but they also limited them to only three shots on goal. A closer examination, however, reveals that the guests&rsquo; efforts were greatly aided by a host that repeatedly gave the ball away, and suffered a number of self-inflicted wounds. That said, any time a club can collect a clean sheet, confidence can only grow. And with Dwyer relegated to the role of bystander, the Revolution could find themselves in a good position to post their third shutout in a row.<BR><BR>&ldquo;Whenever you keep the opponent to zero, you kind of feel good about yourself,&rdquo; Revolution defender <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/132376/Darrius-Barnes">Darrius Barnes</a> said. &ldquo;You feel like you&rsquo;re doing your job, and we feel, as a back line, if we&rsquo;re limiting the opponents&rsquo; chances and keeping them at zero, then we&rsquo;re always going to have a chance (to win).&rdquo;</div>

Nerves were of little concern to Jermaine Jones when he stepped onto the pitch in at BMO Field to make his Revolution debut.<BR><BR>The 32-year-old designated player, who was acquired by the club via league draw last Sunday, entered in the 65th minute of Saturday&rsquo;s 3-0 win over Toronto and, like a seasoned pro, took it all in stride.<BR><BR>&ldquo;I was happy to be back on the pitch, and it&rsquo;s always nice to play in stadiums like here,&rdquo; Jones told the media after the match. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a nice stadium in Toronto, and I try to take everything (in). I was happy to get some minutes on the pitch; it&rsquo;s always good when you get minutes in.&rdquo;<BR><BR></p><div class="mod-inline image image-right"><div style="margin-left:10px; width:300px;"><img src="http://a.espncdn.com//photo/2014/0831/bos_u_jones_kh_300x300.jpg"  alt="Jermaine Jones" border="0" align="middle" /><div style="width: 300px;"><cite>Peter Llewellyn/USA TODAY Sports</cite>Jermaine Jones entered Saturday's game in the 65th minute, giving him a chance to work his way toward game shape.</div></div></div><p>Jones&rsquo;s status for Saturday&rsquo;s contest appeared to be in the air during his introductory press conference on Tuesday. While he expressed his desire to play as soon as possible, the fact that the veteran midfielder hadn&rsquo;t played since the United States&rsquo; Round of 16 contest against Belgium on July 1 suggested he might need a couple of weeks to regain his match fitness. <BR><BR>In the days leading up to Saturday&rsquo;s clash, Jones said that he and coach Jay Heaps discussed a &ldquo;step-by-step&rdquo; plan that would allow him to return to game action and help the Revolution in its playoff push. <BR><BR>That plan, however, didn&rsquo;t appear particularly conservative even before the first whistle. With only a handful of training sessions under his belt, Jones not only made the game-day roster, but he was tapped as the team&rsquo;s first substitute when Daigo Kobayashi exited the game just after the hour. <BR><BR>&ldquo;Jermaine has been excellent around his team, and around our group,&rdquo; Revolution coach Jay Heaps told the media after the match, &ldquo;and we wanted to get him in there and kind of build it in with the training sessions.&rdquo;<BR><BR>While putting his prized midfielder into the match appeared to be a given after the Revolution racked up a trio of goals by the 58th minute, Heaps admitted that Jones&rsquo; cameo didn&rsquo;t go exactly as planned.<BR><BR>&ldquo;For us, it&rsquo;s about fitness,&rdquo; Heaps said about Jones&rsquo; ability to contribute. &ldquo;Unfortunately, when he went into the game, we were trying to keep it a little bit more, and didn&rsquo;t, so he got a little extra fitness in.&rdquo;<BR><BR>Aside from the extra work Jones put in with Toronto tipping the possession scale in their favor, Saturday&rsquo;s debut couldn&rsquo;t have gone smoother. Not only did his new club claim a convincing win over a conference opponent, but Jones appeared to genuinely enjoy himself even before he entered the match.<BR><BR>&ldquo;I was happy on the bench with the boys,&rdquo; Jones said. &ldquo;They played a good game, it was 3-0 (for us), so it was easy to come in, and I was happy that I came back on the pitch.&rdquo;<BR><BR>And with good reason. Nearly two full months had passed since his last action, and with plenty of expectations placed on his shoulders, the U.S. international spoke about his eagerness to aid the club&rsquo;s cause down the stretch.<BR><BR>&ldquo;It was a long break for me and I can feel it, yeah,&rdquo; Jones admitted. &ldquo;I need (more) time on the pitch, of course. But step-by-step, today was 25 minutes, and maybe next game, (it&rsquo;ll be) a little bit longer. I will try my best to be fast (in getting to) 100 percent.&rdquo;</div>

Newly acquired designated player <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/31793/Jermaine-Jones">Jermaine Jones</a> made his much-anticipated debut for the Revolution, while <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/101587/Lee-Nguyen">Lee Nguyen</a> gave them an early lead en route to a convincing 3-0 win over Toronto FC on Saturday at BMO Field.<BR><BR>Nguyen struck his team-leading 10th goal of the season in the second minute, while <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/171650/Kelyn-Rowe">Kelyn Rowe</a> blasted a shot from distance in the 21st minute to secure his second goal of the season. <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/146067/Teal-Bunbury">Teal Bunbury</a> piled it on with his third goal of the season in the 58th minute.<BR><BR></p><div class="mod-inline image image-right"><div style="margin-left:10px; width:300px;"><img src="http://a.espncdn.com//photo/2014/0830/bos_a_jones_kh_300x300.jpg"  alt="Jermaine Jones" border="0" align="middle" /><div style="width: 300px;"><cite>AP Photo/The Canadian Press/Darren Calabrese</cite>Jermaine Jones made his Revolution debut as a second-half substitute.</div></div></div><p>Jones, who was acquired by the club last weekend, made his first appearance for the Revolution in the 65th minute when he came on for <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/90599/Daigo-Kobayashi">Daigo Kobayashi</a>. The U.S. national team member completed 79 percent of his passes during his second-half cameo.<BR><BR>Saturday's win extended the Revolution's recent unbeaten run to three straight (2-0-1), and allowed them to improve their mark to 10-12-3 (33 points). On the other side of the scoreboard, Toronto saw their fortunes sink for the second straight game (0-1-1), and watched their record drop to 9-9-6 (33 points).<BR><BR><strong>What it means:</strong> In the days leading up to Saturday's conference showdown, the Revolution emphasized the need to grind out results down the stretch. But that idea seemed to take a backseat inside of two minutes thanks to a low liner from Nguyen that ended up in the back of the net. From there, it appeared that the guests would have to bunker in and clog the lanes to hold on to their slim margin. That was until Rowe's 21st-minute rocket, which gave the Revolution their first multiple-goal lead since July 30. Bunbury's open-net effort early in the second cinched it to give the Revolution one of their most impressive wins of the season. It may be too early to definitively deem their summertime struggles a relic, but Saturday's performance is a considerable step in the right direction.<BR><BR><strong>Stat of the match:</strong> Lee Nguyen's second-minute strike was the quickest goal scored by the Revolution this season. Prior to Saturday, a 10th-minute goal against Colorado on July 30 served as the earliest strike seen this season. The goalscorer on that one? None other than Nguyen.<BR><BR><strong>Scoreboard watch:</strong> The three points collected north of the border put the Revolution in a three-way tie for third-place along with Toronto and Columbus, all of whom sit at 33 points.<BR><BR><strong>Road success a long time coming:</strong> Saturday's win was the first measure of success the Revolution secured on the road since a 5-3 victory over the Union at PPL Park. Prior to the win over the Reds, the Revolution went 0-5-0 in their last five road tilts, and were outscored by a combined score of 13-3.<BR><BR><strong>Lineup changes:</strong> Coach Jay Heaps made one change the Revolution lineup on Saturday, with Teal Bunbury returning to the XI to fill the right-sided midfielder's spot. With Bunbury back in the lineup, <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/156187/Diego-Fagundez">Diego Fagundez</a> started the match on the bench for the second time in the team's last four contests.<BR><BR><strong>Caldwell to miss next match:</strong> Revolution midfielder <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/183792/Scott-Caldwell">Scott Caldwell</a> collected a 47th-minute caution for his tactical foul on <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/75579/Dominic-Oduro">Dominic Oduro</a>. As a result of the booking, Caldwell, who entered the match on yellow card watch, will be forced to sit out the Revolution's midweek tilt against Sporting Kansas City on Wednesday.<BR><BR><strong>Next up:</strong> It'll be a short turnaround for the Revolution following their road triumph in Toronto as they prepare for second-place Sporting Kansas City on Wednesday at Gillette Stadium. Kickoff is set for 7:30 p.m. The Revolution staked a 2-0 win over Kansas City on April 26.</div>

Following all the hype and hoopla surrounding the <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/31793/Jermaine-Jones">Jermaine Jones</a> signing earlier this week, it's back to the task at hand for the New England Revolution (9-12-3, 30 points), who head to BMO Field on Saturday to take on Toronto FC (9-8-6, 33 points). Kickoff is set for 5 p.m. ET.<BR><BR>It's uncertain whether Jones, the club's most expensive addition ($4.7 million over 18 months) to date, will be ready to go for Saturday's clash. The 32-year-old midfielder is nearly two full months removed from his last meaningful match, the United States' 2-1 loss to Belgium in the round of 16 at the World Cup on July 1.<BR><BR>Regardless, the sixth-place Revolution enter the Labor Day weekend with renewed confidence thanks to a 1-0 win over Chivas USA last week. While it won't go down as the most impressive victory of the season, the three points they pocketed could put their recent struggles behind them and, with improved form, possibly spur a late-season run similar to the one seen last year.<BR><BR>One team that's not looking to reprise any scenes from 2013 is Toronto, who find themselves above the red line this late in the season for the first time in club history. Thanks to a revamped roster that's finally starting to find its form, the third-place Reds have gone unbeaten in four of their last five. But last weekend, they were forced to settle for a disappointing 2-2 draw to Chicago, a result they'd surely like to put behind them on Saturday.<BR><BR>With only three points separating the Revolution and Reds, here's what to watch for on Saturday.<BR><BR>&#8226; <strong>Revs' confidence restored.</strong> Beating one of the worst teams in the league at home by only a single goal may not look great on paper, but don't tell that to midfielder <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/171650/Kelyn-Rowe">Kelyn Rowe</a>. The third-year midfielder, who assisted on the goal against Chivas USA, pointed out a number of positives during Thursday's media scrum. Among them: the stellar play of <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/136529/Bobby-Shuttleworth">Bobby Shuttleworth</a>, who made a couple of heady saves, as well as <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/183792/Scott-Caldwell">Scott Caldwell</a>, who completed 88 percent of his passes.<BR><BR>"It's good to have that confidence again, going in 1-0, and we can still grind this out and get a win," Rowe told the media on Thursday. "But obviously, we want a [few] more."<BR><BR>&#8226; <strong>Can <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/101643/Charlie-Davies">Charlie Davies</a> get back on the score sheet?</strong> Last week's match marked the first time in four weeks that the club's most potent weapon of late didn't factor into the scoring. Davies, who collected two goals and an assist in the weeks leading up to the Chivas USA clash, may not have extended his point streak, but he wasn't a complete nonfactor. He completed 89 percent of his passes and drew four fouls around the area, creating a couple of dangerous set-piece opportunities. Although Toronto isn't likely to give Davies much space to operate, his ability to link with teammates may give him the opportunity to pick up his second assist of the season.<BR><BR>&#8226; <strong>Team defense key against counterattacking Reds.</strong> Much like Chivas USA, Toronto lives and dies by the counterattack. For proof of that, one need only look at its overall possession number: 45.2 percent, which ranks 17th in all of MLS. But a team that catches its opponent off guard can often be more dangerous than a squad that holds the ball with greater frequency. Central midfielder <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/41952/Michael-Bradley">Michael Bradley</a> is one of the best at reading opponents' weaknesses, and his well-timed passes have sprung countless opportunities for his teammates. In light of that, the Revolution have to remain on high alert for the entire 90.<BR><BR>"It's just going to come down to when we get on the field," Revolution center back <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/156223/AJ-Soares">AJ Soares</a> said Thursday. "Do we execute? Do we make little plays here and there? And do we take every play seriously, and not turn off at all? If we do those things, we should be fine."<BR><BR>&#8226; <strong>Road form must improve.</strong> If the Revolution harbor any hopes of springing another late-season run toward the postseason, one of their first orders of business is simply performing better on the road. They've not only lost five straight away from Gillette Stadium since mid-May, but they've been outscored 13-3 during that span. <BR><BR>So where do the Revolution start? As a defender, <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/183796/Andrew-Farrell">Andrew Farrell</a> may be biased, but he recently told the media that a team always gives itself a chance to win by keeping its opponent off the board. To that end, look for the Revolution to key in on defense down the stretch, especially on the road, where points always come at a greater premium.<BR><BR>&#8226; <strong>Expect a gritty, no-frills kind of game.</strong> Saturday's contest isn't likely to be a reminder of why soccer is often called "the beautiful game." In fact, the way Farrell tells it, beauty will be in short supply with two conference foes fighting for playoff spots down the stretch. While the Reds may hold a three-point advantage in the standings with a game in hand over the Revolution, the sophomore fullback believes both sides will be looking to grind out a result.<BR><BR>"[Toronto] has to make sure they get all the points they can, so it's going to be a gritty game," Farrell sad. "I think it's going to be a tough battle, but I'm excited, and the guys are excited to take on a good Toronto FC team."</div>

FOXBOROUGH, Mass. -- If <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/31793/Jermaine-Jones">Jermaine Jones</a> was trying to make a positive impression right off the bat with his new head coach, he passed with flying colors during Tuesday&rsquo;s introductory press conference.<BR><BR>Jones, who was acquired by the Revolution on Sunday, was asked what he was looking forward to the most about joining his new team. In his distinct German accent, the 32-year-old midfielder spoke about what it means to be part of the group coached by Jay Heaps, and how much he wants to join his teammates both on and off the pitch.<BR> <BR>&ldquo;I just loved the way he answered the question about wanting to be around the group,&rdquo; Heaps said afterward. &ldquo;He answered it the way in which a coach wants to see, and his presence on the field is going to give us a huge lift.&rdquo;<BR><BR></p><div class="mod-inline image image-right"><div style="margin-left:10px; width:300px;"><img src="http://a.espncdn.com//photo/2014/0826/bos_u_jjonests_300x200.jpg"  alt="Jermaine Jones" border="0" align="middle" /><div style="width: 300px;"><cite>Stew Milne/USA TODAY Sports</cite>Revolution midfielder Jermaine Jones, posing for photos with the team jersey following a press conference at Gillette on Tuesday, sounded eager to spend time with his new teammates. </div></div></div><p>That&rsquo;s certainly what the coaching staff and brain trust are banking on after reportedly cutting a check for $4.7 million over 18 months to secure the services of the U.S. International. <BR><BR>Jones' arrival comes as the Revolution try to pull themselves out of a stretch in which they&rsquo;ve won only twice in their last 12 games. And it&rsquo;s been no secret that the team&rsquo;s performance in the middle of the park has been a primary cause of their summertime struggles.<BR><BR>While their possession percentage has risen to nearly 50 percent in recent weeks, it&rsquo;s clear that the Revolution have lacked the physicality to punish their opponents. As a result, talented teams like New York and Salt Lake have run clear through the middle of the field virtually without issue.<BR><BR>That trend should change once Jones dons the Revolution uniform for the first time. While the former Schalke 04 mainstay spoke about his desire to play in Saturday&rsquo;s match at Toronto, he knows that he may have to wait. His last meaningful minutes came nearly two months ago during the World Cup.<BR><BR>&ldquo;I would be lying if I said I am 100 percent,&rdquo; Jones said. &ldquo;[But] anyone who knows me knows I will do everything I can to help this team. Maybe I won&rsquo;t start from the beginning; maybe I&rsquo;ll be on the bench. I&rsquo;m the guy who always wants to be around the team.&rdquo;<BR><BR>Although it appears that Jones&rsquo; primary responsibility will be to stabilize the defense and thwart the opposition in the middle third, Heaps said he&rsquo;d also like to see the veteran midfielder contribute across the pitch. <BR><BR>&ldquo;I think there are a lot of different roles within that center midfield that we see him playing,&rdquo; Heaps said. &ldquo;Tactically, we can change the way in which we pivot the triangle. He plays a lot of those roles.&rdquo;<BR><BR>Heaps also alluded to the idea that Jones&rsquo; addition won&rsquo;t mean a change in philosophy as the Revolution approach the final 10 weeks of the regular season.<BR><BR>&ldquo;He fits exactly what we were looking for in a ball-winning midfielder,&rdquo; Heaps said. "[He has] a great presence in there, and so our philosophy stays the same in how we want to coach the team. Now we feel that we have a really big piece of the puzzle, right down the spine.&rdquo;<BR><BR>The rare combination of world-class technique, tactical sense and toughness that Jones brings to the fledgling squad is, of course, the primary reason why ownership paid a princely sum for him to play in Foxborough. But Jones also expects to take on a leadership role.<BR><BR>&ldquo;We have a young team, so maybe sometimes I may have to kick a guy in the [butt],&rdquo; Jones said, with a laugh. &ldquo;But only in a good way. Anyone who knows me knows I like to win, and I will try everything I can to get some wins.&rdquo;<BR></div>

FOXBOROUGH, Mass. -- If you&rsquo;re looking for excitement and thrills, one of the last places you&rsquo;ll find it is on the training pitch of a professional soccer team -- especially during the dog days of the regular season. <BR><BR>But less than 48 hours after the New England Revolution acquired U.S. Men&rsquo;s National Team midfielder Jermaine Jones, the scene at the club&rsquo;s training session on Tuesday was far from ordinary. <BR><BR>&ldquo;Everyone&rsquo;s really excited and buzzing because of what he adds to our team,&rdquo; Revolution striker Charlie Davies said following training. &ldquo;I think everybody knows what a great pickup that is, and how instrumental he&rsquo;ll be for this club.&rdquo;<BR><BR>Jones, who comes to the Revolution fresh off an impressive World Cup campaign, trained with his new club for the first time on Tuesday. Sporting bright orange boots and his trademark dreadlocks, the 32-year-old midfielder participated in short-sided scrimmages and passing drills while a small pack of cameras caught the action.<BR><BR>Of course, what Jones does in training isn&rsquo;t nearly as important as what the Revolution will need from him once he&rsquo;s game fit. As a player who&rsquo;s never met a tackle he didn&rsquo;t like, the former Schalke 04 star is expected to give the Revolution more bite in the middle of the park.<BR><BR>&ldquo;I think everybody knows that we play a great style of soccer,&rdquo; Davies said. &ldquo;We keep it well and having that edge in the midfield will be, I think, the X-factor that we&rsquo;re kind of missing.&rdquo;<BR><BR>Should coach Jay Heaps stick with the standard 4-1-4-1 formation with Jones in tow, the U.S. international is expected to pair centrally with Lee Nguyen and Scott Caldwell. With two creative players flanking him, Jones will likely be asked to devote much of his energies to the defense, where the club hasn&rsquo;t played to the level it approached during last season&rsquo;s third-place finish.<BR>But as effectively as Jones has shown himself in the six spot, Davies believes his new teammate will also help the offense, as well.<BR><BR>&ldquo;I sure am very excited (about the signing),&rdquo; Davies said.  &ldquo;It just really helps me out with a lot of space, having more space, which will be nice.&rdquo;<BR><BR>Of course, it&rsquo;s too early to tell what kind of impact Jones will have on the Revolution&rsquo;s fortunes with only 10 matches remaining in the regular season. The club currently sits outside the playoff picture in sixth place. But with only 13 points separating the Revs from the top of the table, Jones will surely be counted upon to pilot the squad to a second straight trip to the postseason.<BR><BR>Although Jones has yet to make his official debut, it&rsquo;s already clear that his impact on the team has been nothing but positive.<BR><BR>&ldquo;It gives us a huge energy boost,&rdquo; Davies said. &ldquo;If this doesn&rsquo;t excite you, then there&rsquo;s something wrong with you. We&rsquo;re all looking forward to having him join us on the field as soon as possible.&rdquo;</div>

Less than 24 hours after acquiring the summer&rsquo;s most vaunted free agent, the New England Revolution added another weapon to their arsenal by acquiring Dutch striker Geoffrey Castillion via free transfer on Monday.<BR><BR>Castillion, who came up through the famed Ajax Youth Academy, was acquired by the club a day after they added U.S. Men&rsquo;s National Team regular Jermaine Jones. The 23-year-old forward was most recently on loan to Dutch Eredivisie side NEC Nijmegen from Ajax. He will be officially added to the roster upon receipt of his P1-Visa and International Transfer Certificate. <BR><BR>&ldquo;Geoffrey is a big, strong target forward with several years of experience in the Dutch first division,&rdquo; Revolution general manager Michael Burns said in a club release on Monday. &ldquo;He will add a different dynamic to our attack and also give us more options up front. Once he finalizes the immigration process, we&rsquo;re looking forward to getting him right into training.&rdquo;<BR><BR>The 6-3, 170 lbs. striker comes to Foxborough following a season in which he split time with Ajax&rsquo;s reserves and NEC Nijmegen. During the first half of the 2013-14 season, he played in six contests for the Ajax reserves and tallied once before he was loaned to Nijmegen for the latter half of the season. Once there, he scored twice in nine appearances across all competitions, including the Dutch Cup quarterfinals and semifinals. <BR><BR>Castillion kicked off his pro career in March 2011 with Ajax, and was subsequently loaned to Eredivisie side RKC Waalwijk the following season. He scored seven times in 33 matches for Waalwijk, who finished ninth in their first season following their promotion from Eerste Divisie. <BR><BR>The striker&rsquo;s stay with the fledgling side proved to be a short one, though, as he was loaned to Heracles Almelo for the 2012-13 season. In 33 appearances, he collected four goals for the club&rsquo;s first team, but amassed 13 goals in 12 games for the club&rsquo;s reserves during the same season.<BR><BR>In addition to his club career, Castillion has also featured with the Netherlands at the youth international level. He was a member of the Dutch side that advanced to the semifinals of the 2008 UEFA Youth U-17 championship, a tournament in which he scored two goals for his country.<BR><BR>Castillion will occupy an international roster spot, and will wear number 39. <BR></div>

The New England Revolution got a major boost when they acquired Jermaine Jones on Sunday.<BR><BR>Jones, 33, is en route to Foxborough after the league conducted a blind draw between the Revolution and the Chicago Fire for the former Schalke 04 and current U.S. national team midfielder&rsquo;s services.<BR><BR>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very excited to come to MLS and join the Revolution,&rdquo; Jones said in a statement. &ldquo;New England is an exciting team on the rise, and I believe I can come in and help the team make a push toward MLS Cup. Playing with the U.S. National Team has given me a great connection with the American fans and I&rsquo;m looking forward to playing in front of them every weekend. I&rsquo;m ready to get started with the Revs.&rdquo; <BR><BR>Terms of the deal, which made Jones a designated player signing, were not disclosed, per MLS and club rules. However, ESPN analyst Alexi Lalas reported on Sunday that the deal is worth $4.7 million for 1 1/2 years.  <BR><BR>The 14-year veteran has spent the bulk of his career in the German Bundesliga, where he made his name as a gritty, yet technically gifted central midfielder. He most recently played for Turkish side Besiktas before expressing his desire to play in MLS.<BR><BR>At the international level, Jones has earned 43 caps with the United States, scoring three goals -- the most memorable being the blast he uncorked against Portugal during the 2014 World Cup. He was a member of Germany&rsquo;s youth national teams, but a recent change to FIFA&rsquo;s rules allowed the Frankfurt-born midfielder the opportunity to make a one-time switch to the U.S., where his father is from. <BR><BR>Jones will join a side in desperate need of a midfield general after starting defensive midfielder Andy Dorman suffered an MCL sprain last month, an injury that is likely to keep him out through September. Scott Caldwell and A.J. Soares both have manned the six spot in Dorman&rsquo;s absence, but neither has been able to fortify a midfield unit that has struggled to hold the ball in recent weeks.<BR><BR>But the team&rsquo;s struggles haven&rsquo;t been limited to the possession scale. Over the course of their recent slide -- which has seen the team triumph only twice in its last 12 games -- the Revolution have averaged less than a goal per game (0.92). Jones&rsquo; ability to thread high-quality passes should allow the likes of Charlie Davies, Kelyn Rowe and Diego Fagundez to rejuvenate their form.<BR><BR>Of course, the world-class skills that Jones brings to the pitch only tell part of the story. Although he&rsquo;s noted for collecting the occasional caution, the veteran midfielder brings leadership that the team certainly could use down the stretch. In a sense, Dorman&rsquo;s injury was a one-two punch to the Revolution not only because of his solid play, but because of his ability to organize and rally his younger teammates. <BR><BR>&ldquo;This is a great opportunity for us to add one of the best players in the United States to our club,&rdquo; Revolution investor/operator Jonathan Kraft said in a statement. &ldquo;We thought Jermaine was the best player for the U.S. in the World Cup and we are excited to welcome him to New England. When we learned that he was interested in signing with MLS, we immediately informed the league of our interest. He is a dynamic player and is certain to have a tremendous impact on our team and in our community.&rdquo;<BR><BR>The Revolution currently sit in sixth place in the East with 30 points, one point short of making the playoffs. With Jones on board, the Revolution become an immediate favorite to book their ticket to the postseason for the second straight year.</div>

FOXBOROUGH, Mass. -- It sure looked like it was going to be one of those nights for the New England Revolution on Saturday after heading into halftime with nothing to show for their first-half dominance of a struggling Chivas USA squad.<BR><BR>The hosts not only held the better of the possession (67.8 percent), but connected on 85.6 percent of their passes as well. And yet, they marched into the locker room at the break with the scoreboard completely unblemished, much to their dismay.<BR><BR>But after coach Jay Heaps called upon his players to make the appropriate adjustments, the Revolution were able to finally break through in the 56th minute to grab a 1-0 win on Saturday.<BR><BR></p><div class="mod-inline image image-right"><div style="margin-left:10px; width:300px;"><img src="http://a.espncdn.com//photo/2014/0823/soc_u_revs11_300x200.jpg"  alt="Diego Fagundez" border="0" align="middle" /><div style="width: 300px;"><cite>Bob DeChiara/USA TODAY Sports</cite>Chivas USA midfielder Akira Kaji (right) passes the ball past Revolution forward Diego Fagundez during the first half Saturday.</div></div></div><p>"We had our way with the ball, but it just wasn't penetrating, so that was our adjustment at halftime," Heaps said. "One of things that we wanted to do was more penetration and more runs that were a little bit riskier, and if we didn't get that ball, we wanted to jump on them."<BR><BR>The fact that the Revolution encountered difficulties getting through the Chivas defense came as no surprise, of course. The Goats entered the match winless in their last five, and were looking to do nothing more than stifle their hosts with the hope of grinding out a result.<BR><BR>However, even though they managed to clog up the middle of the pitch, a couple of opportunities fell to the Revolution during the first half.<BR><BR><a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/101587/Lee-Nguyen">Lee Nguyen</a> chipped a pass over to <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/101643/Charlie-Davies">Charlie Davies</a>, who broke free of his defender but was beat to the ball by keeper <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/57094/Dan-Kennedy">Dan Kennedy</a> in the third minute. Later in the half, it was Nguyen who pierced the backline and fired an open shot that lodged itself in the side netting during the 36th minute.<BR><BR>Sensing the need to stretch the Chivas defense, Heaps implored his players to play the ball east-to-west. In order to do so, he asked fullbacks <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/132376/Darrius-Barnes">Darrius Barnes</a> and <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/183796/Andrew-Farrell">Andrew Farrell</a> to not only make forays forward, but to alternate those runs in order to ensure that there was still cover behind.<BR><BR>The adjustment worked to perfection not long after they returned to the pitch after halftime. And with Chivas sticking to their script, the Revolution put their guest to the test.<BR><BR>With the ball firmly in their possession, <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/156187/Diego-Fagundez">Diego Fagundez</a> played a long pass wide to <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/171650/Kelyn-Rowe">Kelyn Rowe</a>, who then played a give-and-go pass with Daigo Kobyashi. On the return ball, Rowe put it on the foot of Nguyen, who took a touch and fired a shot that beat Kennedy at the right post in the 56th minute.<BR><BR>The key on the play was Rowe's commitment to create from the wing, a spot where the third-year midfielder hadn't exactly shown himself as a world-beater in the past. Nevertheless, Rowe remained faithful to his assignment, and his efforts paid off at what proved to be the most crucial moment.<BR><BR>"I played there a little bit during my first year, and have a little bit this year, as well," Rowe said. "You just have to stay wide a little (more). I found myself coming in a lot and trying to find the ball, and the guys gave it to me every once in a while. It was good."<BR><BR>But it wasn't exactly clear sailing for the Revolution following Nguyen's blast. While they continued to stay wide, and continued to create problems for Chivas, <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/136529/Bobby-Shuttleworth">Bobby Shuttleworth</a> was called upon to make a couple of saves in the latter stages.<BR><BR>While Heaps praised his goalkeeper for preserving the victory -- a much-needed one at that after going winless in 10 of their last 11 -- much of the credit was given to the team-wide effort required to not only recognize the problem, but to execute on the solution.<BR><BR>"I think Chivas came in with a gameplan to really make it difficult for us, and they did," Heaps said. "I think we made a couple of adjustments at halftime, and were able to open them up a little bit."</div>

FOXBOROUGH, Mass. -- Leave it to <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/101587/Lee-Nguyen">Lee Nguyen</a> to get the job done for the Revolution.<BR><BR>The club's leading scorer tallied his ninth goal of the season on Saturday to give his squad a 1-0 win over Chivas USA on Saturday at Gillette Stadium.<BR><BR>On the other end of the pitch, <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/136529/Bobby-Shuttleworth">Bobby Shuttleworth</a> stopped four shots to collect his sixth clean sheet of the season.<BR><BR>With the win, the Revolution snapped a two-game winless streak (0-1-1), while Chivas USA was left out of the win column for the sixth straight occasion (0-4-2).<BR><BR><strong>What it means:</strong> It appeared early on that the usual issues with finishing and final balls would doom the Revolution to another disappointing draw. While they tipped the possession scale at or near 70 percent for much of the night with Chivas digging in and playing for the draw, the best the Revolution could muster was a series of half-chances by the break. But just before the hour mark, Nguyen rescued his teammates when he blasted a shot beyond the reach of <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/57094/Dan-Kennedy">Dan Kennedy</a>. While Nguyen got the job done up the pitch, Shuttleworth played particularly well between the sticks, where he made four saves -- two of the acrobatic variety -- to seal the victory for the Revolution.<BR><BR><strong>Stat of the match:</strong> Chivas USA came to Foxborough looking to dig in and disrupt the Revolution, and for the most part, succeeded in doing so by outfouling their hosts 20-5.<BR><BR><strong>Scoreboard watch:</strong> With the Red Bulls beating the Impact 4-2 on Saturday, the Revolution remain in sixth place in the Eastern Conference.<BR><BR><strong>Two changes to Revs lineup:</strong> Revolution coach Jay Heaps made a pair of changes to his lineup from the one the used against Portland last week. <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/90599/Daigo-Kobayashi">Daigo Kobayashi</a> received his first start since a July 19 match at FC Dallas, while <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/146067/Teal-Bunbury">Teal Bunbury</a> was relegated to the bench for the first time since a July 4 contest at Real Salt Lake. In the back, <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/132376/Darrius-Barnes">Darrius Barnes</a> manned the left fullback's spot in place of an injured <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/132379/Kevin-Alston">Kevin Alston</a>.<BR><BR><strong>Familiar face back in Foxborough:</strong> Former Revolution midfielder/defender <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/135800/Tony-Lochhead">Tony Lochhead</a> made his first visit to Gillette Stadium on Saturday in more than seven years. Lochhead was drafted by the Revolution in 2005, and collected two assists in 16 games for the local XI in 2006. He was released at the start of the 2007 season, and went on to play in the Australian A-League from 2007-13, and played in the 2010 World Cup for his native New Zealand.<BR><BR><strong>Taylor makes his debut:</strong> Newly acquired striker <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/177455/Tony-Taylor">Tony Taylor</a> made his Revolution debut in the 81st minute when he came on for <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/101643/Charlie-Davies">Charlie Davies</a>. The former U.S. U-20 star completed all three of the passes he made off the bench in his MLS debut.<BR><BR><strong>Heading north of the border:</strong> The Revolution will journey north to BMO Field on Saturday, Aug. 30 to face Toronto FC for the second time this season. Kickoff is set for 5 p.m. ET. In their initial encounter, the Revolution staked a 2-1 comeback win over the Reds at BMO Field on May 3.</div>
